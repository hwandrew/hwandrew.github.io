    <div id="aboutText">
      I created this website from scratch as a side project starting December
      2017. Using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, I wanted to create a
      personal portfolio that showcases both my technical abilities and
      appreciation for aesthetics.

    <br /><br />
    <div>
      I am a creative developer working on Outlook for Web at Microsoft. I
      graduated from University of Michigan and studied Computer Science with a
      minor in Art & Design. I have gained a deep appreciation for technology &
      aesthetics throughout my work experience & education, and love to combine
      the two fields together. Going into college, I always loved creative
      challenges and had a strong passion for product design, despite my
      inability to draw. It wasn't until after I had started university where I
      was introduced to the world of digital media as a medium for creativity,
      and that is when I transitioned into Computer Science. As I have continued
      to further my education, both video game development and web development
      have piqued my interest and are two fields that I would love to further
      learn about and work in professionally. In terms of video game
      development, I have worked a bit with the Unity Game Engine and C#. For
      web development, I have been working on honing in my skills for front-end
      development, working with JavaScript and React.js as a foundation.

      Beyond being a developer, I consider myself an avid EDM fan, "gamer",
      amateur photographer, and a fitness lover. I have also recently started to
      explore 3D modelling with Blender for fun and will be sure to put up some
      projects I completed here on the website!
